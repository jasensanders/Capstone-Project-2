Welcome to My Capstone project!

To build this you will need 2 keys:

1. A Key from The Movie Data Base which you can get here:
	https://www.themoviedb.org/account/signup  -and Sign up.
	Then Click on the "API" link from the left hand sidebar within your account page.
2. A key from Search UPC data base which you can get here:
	http://searchupc.com/developers/ -and Sign up.

Put both of these keys in the strings.xml file under:
